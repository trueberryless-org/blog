It all started when I noticed the credit link to [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) in the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build). Positioned at the bottom of the Table of Contents, it was simple but stylish, and I loved how it subtly gave credit. When Starlight introduced its own credit option, I activated it in all my projects. It was small, understated, and tucked at the bottom of each page—nice, but easy to miss.

That’s when I thought, *What if others want a cooler credit option, like the one from the Astro docs?* So, I set out to create a plugin. Initially, it was just a fun project to link to Starlight and Astro in a more noticeable way. I started with two presets—one for Starlight and one for Astro—and shared my work on the Astro Discord.

That’s where things took off. [One awesome Astro maintainer](https://www.rainsberger.ca/) suggested, *"Why not link to the Starlight Blog too?"* and I thought, *What a brilliant idea!* I added the blog as a third preset, and suddenly, the plugin was more than I had ever planned.

But I wasn’t done yet. It bugged me that the credits were always in English, so I decided to make them translate automatically based on the languages supported by Starlight. That’s when the real adventure began. I reached out to the community for help translating the plugin into different languages. The response was incredible! People from around the world offered to pitch in, and what started as a solo project turned into a global collaboration. Along the way, I made new friends and learned so much from everyone involved. Now, the plugin supports around ten languages, and more translations keep coming.

What started as a simple idea turned into something I’m really proud of: **Starlight Cooler Credit** . It’s more than just a plugin—it’s a way to give credit with style, customization, and a touch of global teamwork.
