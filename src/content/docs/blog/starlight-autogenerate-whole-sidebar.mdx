Have you ever wanted to simplify sidebar generation in your [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) project? Have you tried autogenerating the entire sidebar only to find it doesn't let you customise the structure to your needs?

This post demonstrates two Starlight features that make fully autogenerated sidebars flexible and reduce maintenance.

{/* excerpt */}

## Use case

In medium to large Starlight projects, the problem arises that the manual creation and maintenance of the [Starlight sidebar configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#sidebar) is a tedious and time-consuming task.

In the past, Starlight didn't provide the right primitives for this, and the recommended approach was to move the autogeneration of the sidebar configuration one level deeper - so that only folders without nested subfolders were autogenerated. However, with the introduction of [Route Data](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/route-data/) and the more recent [`generateId()` hook of `docsLoader`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#generateid), these scenarios can now be solved much more easily and efficiently.

## Solving the ordering issue

A common problem always was: "How can I customise the order of sidebar folders if I autogenerate the sidebar?" Old issues like [#1223](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/issues/1223) suggest a solution inspired by [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com) where each segment of the whole route can be [prefixed with numbers + dots](https://v2.content.nuxt.com/usage/content-directory#ordering) to determine numeric ordering on a file-based level. An example for such a project could look like this:

<FileTree>

- src/content/docs/nested-folder
  - 1.frameworks
    - 1.vue.md
    - 2.nuxt.md
  - 2.examples
    - 1.vercel.md
    - 2.netlify.md

</FileTree>


If you want to use this approach in Starlight, it doesn't work out-of-the-box, but with a simple setup you can make it work.

Starlight [0.35.0](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/releases/tag/%40astrojs%2Fstarlight%400.35.0) introduced a callback function which you can pass to `docsLoader()` that can manipulate the id (URL) of the generated page. By splitting the entry by `"/"` and removing any number + dot on the segment level, you have the same functionality now in Starlight:

```ts {6-7,12-19}
// src/content.config.ts
import { defineCollection } from "astro:content";
import { docsLoader } from "@astrojs/starlight/loaders";
import { docsSchema } from "@astrojs/starlight/schema";

const leadingNumberAndDotRegEx = /^\d+\./;
const fileExtensionRegEx = /\.(md|mdx)$/;

export const collections = {
  docs: defineCollection({
    loader: docsLoader({
      // Remove file extension and
      // leading numbers + dot from each segment
      generateId: ({ entry }) =>
        entry
          .replace(fileExtensionRegEx, "")
          .split("/")
          .map((segment) => segment.replace(leadingNumberAndDotRegEx, ""))
          .join("/"),
    }),
    schema: docsSchema(),
  }),
};

```

The URL to access the pages now changes e.g., from `/nested-folder/1.frameworks/1.vue` to `/nested-folder/frameworks/vue`.

However, the folder names in the sidebar still include the `1.` prefixes. So let's solve the sidebar manipulation as well:

## Solving the sidebar folder naming issue

Starlight [0.32.0](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/releases/tag/%40astrojs%2Fstarlight%400.32.0) introduced [Route Data](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/route-data/), which we can now utilize to manipulate folder names in the sidebar to

1. remove any leading number + dot from the folder name and
2. apply "Title Case" so they don't look completely lowercase

```ts
// src/routeData.ts
import { defineRouteMiddleware } from "@astrojs/starlight/route-data";

const leadingNumberAndDotRegEx = /^\d+\./;
const wordSplitterRegEx = /\w\S*/g;

function toTitleCase(str: string) {
  return str.replace(wordSplitterRegEx, (word) => {
    return word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1).toLowerCase();
  });
}

function cleanGroupLabels(entries: any[]) {
  for (const entry of entries) {
    if (entry.type === "group") {
      // Remove leading number + dot
      let label = entry.label.replace(leadingNumberAndDotRegEx, "");
      // Convert to Title Case
      entry.label = toTitleCase(label);
      // Recurse into children
      cleanGroupLabels(entry.entries);
    }
  }
}

export const onRequest = defineRouteMiddleware((context) => {
  const { sidebar } = context.locals.starlightRoute;
  cleanGroupLabels(sidebar);
});
```

:::note[Internationalisation (i18n)]
Note that [internationalisation (i18n) of folder names](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/sidebar/#internationalization) is a missing feature with such a setup as there is currently nowhere to define translations of folder names, they just get converted into title case. Implementing logic to dynamically load translations could involve reading the [`locale` field from the route data](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/route-data/#locale) and define translations in `json` files. Otherwise, [use HiDeoo's plugin](#using-hideoos-plugin), which [supports i18n](https://starlight-auto-sidebar.netlify.app/guides/i18n/).
:::

Don't forget to add the `routeData.ts` file to your `astro.config.mjs`:

```ts ins={11}
// astro.config.mjs
    starlight({
      title: "Autogenerate whole sidebar",
      social: [{ icon: "github", label: "GitHub", href: "https://github.com/withastro/starlight" }],
      sidebar: [
        {
          label: "Root Folder",
          autogenerate: { directory: "nested-folder" },
        },
      ],
      routeMiddleware: "./src/routeData.ts",
    }),
```

Of course you can adjust the code to your needs (e.g., remove the "Title Case" transformation because your file names are already written correctly).

## Using HiDeoo's plugin

If you want to autogenerate your whole sidebar and still have the flexibility to customise everything you want, [HiDeoo](https://github.com/HiDeoo) also made a dedicated plugin for such use cases: [Starlight Auto Sidebar](https://starlight-auto-sidebar.netlify.app).

Especially those two features got mentioned in this article:

- Controlling the [order](https://starlight-auto-sidebar.netlify.app/metadata/#order) of individual directories
- Adapting the [displayed label](https://starlight-auto-sidebar.netlify.app/metadata/#label) of individual folders

However, if you want to automate the whole generation without having to specify labels and orders manually for each directory, coding the solution yourself (with some guidelines in this blog) is the preferred and recommended solution.

If you want to check out the code presented in this blog, feel free to visit the [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/trueberryless/starlight-autogenerate-whole-sidebar?file=src%2Fcontent.config.ts) or the source code in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/trueberryless/starlight-autogenerate-whole-sidebar).
