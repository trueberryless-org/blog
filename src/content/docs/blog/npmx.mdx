Here I am. Thoughtfully sitting like the French sculptor Auguste Rodin imagined "The Thinker" (_Le Penseur_) in the late 19th century. Thinking about how to write a blog post which should express deepest gratitude, but unable to find the right words to do so.

{/* excerpt */}

Projects come and go. They develop; they move on. Sometimes they finish, but often they don't - especially personal or side projects. But they rarely evolve at light speed. They hardly explode. Nuke the entire ecosystem with their majesty. Rise like a superhuman. Unite. Shine. And prefigure. Bring together what was thought far apart. Combining thoughts of hundreds through vision. Making the impossible possible. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't have become a software developer. But rather a poet. Until I publish my content... and I realize that tools like npmx are the ink for my digital poetry.

Poetry or not aside: I recently discovered a newly forming community of talented people, connected by the vision of creating a fast and modern browser for the npm registry. What sounds simple on paper - or should I say in the `README.md` - got features more quickly than 20.000 lightnings strike the ground - globally, goes without saying. In the early days - before people needed vacation, the young project's main branch struggled to keep up with all the good stuff called "commits" in our world that came around every 22 minutes, 24/7. I wouldn't have wondered if GitHub had spun up a dedicated Azure data centre just for our commitment.

While many faces were familiar, the sheer amount of developers, designers, security and a18y experts, organisers, sponsors and all other professionals where I didn't even know they existed before was just mind-blowing. ¡Ay! Mi persona está flabbergastado. I am definitely proud of what we have already achieved. And I am looking forward on what we will achieve. As developers, but much more as a community. I am here to stay!
