It has been more than two and a half years since the release of ChatGPT. The 30<sup>th</sup> November, 2022 marked the beginning of a new era. The start of AI. Nowadays, many professions and people in private lives, especially in the information technology sector, use it on a daily basis. And we do not even know where we are on the Gartner hype cycle or if AI will improve following Kurzweilâ€™s "Law of Accelerating Returns". 

The trend is still rising, but at the same time I have noticed a slight but steady degradation of knowledge on a human basis because people delegate more and more creative work to AI. As a result, I have decided to write a little blog post, where I can share my thoughts, trying to stop this abusive usage of Artificial Intelligence which would ruin our cognitive capabilities. And although I know that very little people read this, it does not stop me from trying. Otherwise, I might have missed my opportunity in helping humanities future.

> **Disclaimer**: This whole blog post is created from my observations of developments of social changes with special focus on ways of using Artificial Intelligence with my interpretation and is therefore very opinionated. I have not looked at any studies that would support or oppose my opinion.

## How people tend to use AI

AI is awesome. I do not want to question this statement. It helped and still helps me improve my workflow, gathering new knowledge, diving into new waters and exploring new technologies. For people who are not interested in how AI works, such intelligent tools seem like magic. As a result, I like to see their eyes sparkle and their mouths left open when I explain to them that everything AI is based on is probability. What word is most likely to be the next one based on properties and emotions in a highly dimensional virtual space. [But that is another topic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPZh9BOjkQs)

What I would like to focus on, is how people got to use AI especially in the past months if not already years. Since our brains are lazy by default, we tend to outsource more and more work to AI the less focused we are on a specific task. In other words, if you do not put most of your commitment into your current project, you are likely at the verge of just prompting an AI with it. Another potential reason of offshoring work to the AI world is ignorance of underlying technologies, which make it difficult for you to come up with your own solution(s).

I am by no means a scientist, but I think that watching AI doing your work - because due to your incompetence the outcome you produce is not aligning with your vision - gives you so much dopamine that your brain wants to do it more often. Moreover, the human being as a social figure always aims to be connected to somebody and engaging with AI satisfies those needs. This behaviour is typical for our brains and also happens when watching social media or consuming explicit content. It is deeply marked in our cerebral cortex and the whole gaming industry and entertainment sectors use it recklessly to optimize for money.

I noticed this trend myself, as you can clearly see from [some of my posts where I admittedly used AI](/blog/authors/artificial-intelligence/) to help me write them. But I think this is not a shame. Every content creator who uses AI should experience first-hand the pitfalls of creating content directly for the viewer or reader, in order to realise how little they subsequently know about the topic. This will enable them to learn from their mistake and be aware of how easily laziness can lead you down such a despised path. Alternatively, you are one of the smart people who can see this pitfall before jumping into it.

## Negative side effects

I pointed out the main drawbacks of using AI too extensively which I observed. I will now give you two more smaller reasons - I noticed in myself - why you should not use AI for expressive work.

### Communication decline

While watching a promotion video from "The Browser Companyâ„¢" (see the last link in the [resource section below](#resources-with-better-evidence)) I noticed that visions can be very far apart nowadays. I see this trend not only in the Dia browser, but in many different aspects of technologies and part of our lives. There is one side of the trend which wants to integrate AI everywhere possible, widening our dependencies of it. One example is using AI to construct, create and write messages with our closest friends and colleagues because it makes us more efficient. I believe that it just makes us stupid in the long run. 

If people do not train their brains for coming up with words for communication, building useful sentences and meaning that can be understood by other human beings, our very foundation of interacting with each other is broken and we would be back at the level of _Homo habilis_ - the last species that likely did not use fully developed verbal language. See, I used AI to help me research this very bit of information, but chose my words consciously to express myself. This way, I not only learned something new, but can now also remember it. A capability you will never have when outsourcing writing to AI.

### Loneliness

Being alone on a mental level is in my opinion one of the most underrated modern dangers of society. The ironic part about it is, that if everyone is alone, we all have it in common, making us not alone with each ones loneliness. But my thoughts are wandering in other oceans again.

AI strongly encourages us to be alone. It ~acts~ was intentionally trained to act as a perfect friend, colleague or whatever you wanna call it. Recently I noticed that ChatGPT's responses explicitly include my name which feels very weird on multiple layers if you ask me. One could argue that this is private artificial doxxing, which of course is a oxymoron in itself as doxxing by definition is public. Nevertheless, the more you use AI, the more _often_ you want to use AI. Particularly after the introduction of AI voice modes this trend kept rising like there is no tomorrow. Congratulations ClosedAI, you just reinvented addiction.

In worst case scenarios, this can leads people to fear talking with other people. Abandoning friendships. Withdrawal from society. Such habits are serious problems and should best be examined by a doctor or psychologist.

## Conclusion



No blog needs to be perfect as you might have recognised with this one. There are probably some grammatical error here and there, some sentences that actually do not make sense, but this makes humans human. And if have a blog and also make some mistakes, you should be proud of them. Read more about my opinion of writing blog posts [here](/blog/writing-blogs-is-hard-and-easy/).

## Helpful phrases

What I mean is that AI should be used for brainstorming and helping each individual for creating an end product, but not for communicating with other people and the final results themselves (eg image creation, writing blogs, posts on social media, communicating with chats, motivation speeches, essays, ...)

AI has a place in ideation, but expressive work should remain human. AI can help behind the scenes.
