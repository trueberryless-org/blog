It has been more than two and a half years since the release of ChatGPT. The 30<sup>th</sup> November, 2022 marked the beginning of a new era. The start of AI. Nowadays, many professions and people in private lives, especially in the information technology sector, use it on a daily basis. And we do not even know when on the Gartner (TODO) hype cycle we are yet. 

The trend is still rising, but at the same time I have noticed a slight but steady degradation of knowledge on a human basis because people delegate more and more creative work to AI. As a result, I have decided to write a little blog post, where I can share my thoughts, trying to stop this abusive usage of Artificial Intelligence which would ruin our cognitive capabilities. And although I know that very little people read this, it does not stop me from trying. Otherwise, I might have missed my opportunity in helping humanities future.

> **Disclaimer**: This whole blog post is created from my observations of developments of social changes with special focus on ways of using Artificial Intelligence with my interpretation and therefore very opinionated. I have not looked at any studies that would support or oppose my opinion.

## How people tend to use AI

AI is awesome. I do not want to question this statement. It helped and still helps me improve my workflow, gathering new knowledge, diving into new waters and exploring new technologies. For people who are not interested in how AI works such intelligent tools seem like magic. As a result, I like to see their eyes sparkle and their mouths left open when I explain to them that everything AI is based on is probability. What word is most likely to be the next one based on properties and emotions in a highly dimensional virtual space. [But that is another topic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPZh9BOjkQs)

What I would like to focus on is how people got to use AI especially in the past months if not already years. 

I noticed this trend myself, as you can clearly see from [some of my posts where I admittedly used AI](/blog/authors/artificial-intelligence/) to help me write them. But I think this is not a shame. Every content creator who uses AI should experience first-hand the pitfalls of creating content directly for the viewer or reader, in order to realise how little they subsequently know about the topic. This will enable them to learn from their mistake and be aware of how easily laziness can lead you down such a despised path. Alternatively, you are one of the smart people who can see this pitfall before jumping into it.

## Proposal of AI usage layer model

## Overview

- Intro: People use AI everywhere
- Disclaimer: Blog is my opinion, not backed up by studies
- Arguments against usage of AI for expressive work (Cognitive Erosion, Unlearning of communication skills, Isolation: Ask AI before colleagues)
- Proposal of AI usage layer model
- Conclusion: Do whatever you want, but be aware of degradation of your own brain 

## Helpful phrases

What I mean is that AI should be used for brainstorming and helping each individual for creating an end product, but not for communicating with other people and the final results themselves (eg image creation, writing blogs, posts on social media, communicating with chats, motivation speeches, essays, ...)

AI has a place in ideation, but expressive work should remain human. AI can help behind the scenes.
