This blog post could have had many titles. One reason is that I still can't decide where to take my first ["Mindspace"](/blog/tags/mindspace/) blog. Whilst I initially the thought about the degradation of our writing skills due to AI arose while watching [a product placement video from _The Browser Company_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCZUIm4S9QQ), I realized that this problem spans over way more aspects of society than I thought. Therefore, I decided to include some of the titles that wandered around my mind here:

- "Reasons Why We Shouldn't Replace Our Writing Skills With AI-generated Content"
- "AI Is Ruining The Brains of The Next Generation"
- "How Excessive Use of AI Damages Our Brains in the Long Run"
