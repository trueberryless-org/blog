Yes, this title is a little reference to the awesome series "Arcane" on Netflix, but that's not what this little post is about.

Today, I wanna write some random words about earworms, a term originated in the German language as "Ohrwurm" and its translation borrowed word-by-word. The meaning behind this rather abstract term are catchy tunes or _sticky music_ as Wikipedia likes to call it. This phenomenon often occurs to humans unpredictably, more likely though when our thoughts wander somewhere else as reality.

{/* excerpt */}

While many of my blog post ideas occasionally happen on train rides, lying in bed or when I'm just thinking about life as a normal human always does casually, the inspiration for this post literally hit me whilst showering, as the good old _shower thoughts_ are intended to be. The reason - as you might be able to guess from the topic - was an earworm about a melody where I could have sworn that I haven't heard it for a long time, like 4-5 weeks.

And this always seems to be the confusing parts about earworms: Nobody really knows who decides when to play. Is it the brain when it's a little numb. You know what I mean, those moments when you don't really know what you are currently thinking and you don't have to think about what to think, you are just enjoying the moment. There is another Austrian idiom for this exact scenario: "ins Narrenkastl schauen", which means something like _to stare into space_. And I think that exactly those absent-minded moments are the origin and reason why earworms happen.

But this still leaves the question: Who decides what to play in someone's head when it happens? Like who is the DJ? From my own experience I have noticed a repeating pattern, especially if you have just been listening to music in the last half of an hour. My brain at least, likes to repeat parts of the **penultimate song** heard, in other words the song, which was played before the last song. This theory works even better if the last song was paused in the middle or just not perfectly at the end of it.

The exact reason for that is completely unknown to me, but if I had to guess, I would say that the rhythms of the completed song (the penultimate one) are still ringing somewhere in your mind since the song itself was maybe one of those "I-just-fade-out-my-volume-to-end-me"-songs, which is not my favourite type of endings to music, but it encourages the brain to go on. 

At least that's what I think. I would be very interested if you have experienced similar patterns, so feel free to write your own blog post about it or just share this one with friends so you can discuss it with them!
