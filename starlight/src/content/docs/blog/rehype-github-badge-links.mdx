import StarlightBadgeLink from "../../../components/StarlightBadgeLink.astro";

Recently, I added a very little neat feature to this blog, which you might have noticed as a regular reader. It's nothing huge, but gives every blog this little lovely touch I, which I have longed for a long time. I am ~talking~ writing about all those green badges with profile pictures you can see in this blog as well.

The inspiration to create them was taken from none other than [Antfu](https://github.com/antfu) himself, as he has those badges all over the place on his website (as time of writing).

Initially I thought they would require some long and tedious programming session to accomplish the same visual beauty. However, after some Vibe Coding - as [Andrej Karpathy coined the term](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383) - I quickly realized that those badges were just a small [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs) plugin away from existence.

This is the whole code behind the rehype plugin:

```ts
// src/lib/rehype-github-badge-links.ts
import { h } from "hastscript";
import { visit } from "unist-util-visit";

export default function rehypeGitHubBadgeLinks() {
  return (tree) => {
    visit(tree, "element", (node) => {
      if (
        node.tagName === "a" &&
        typeof node.properties?.href === "string" &&
        node.properties.href.startsWith("https://github.com/")
      ) {
        const match = node.properties.href.match(
          /^https:\/\/github\.com\/([\w-]+)\/?$/
        );
        if (match) {
          const username = match[1];

          // Add GitHub badge class
          node.properties.className = (node.properties.className || []).concat(
            "gh-badge"
          );

          // Build avatar image
          const avatarImg = h("img", {
            src: `https://github.com/${username}.png`,
            alt: username,
          });

          // Prepend avatar image to original children
          node.children.unshift(avatarImg);
        }
      }
    });
  };
}
```

Basically all this plugin does, is walking through the HTML, looking for links which reference to any GitHub profile. If it finds one, it adds an `<img>` tag before the text content with the profile picture of the GitHub user or organisation. This is possible very consistently thanks to GitHub's feature of making the picture available as a resource behind the profile link appended with `.png`. Read more about that feature in [this awesome article on `dev.to`](https://dev.to/10xlearner/how-to-get-the-profile-picture-of-a-github-account-1d82).

With a little bit of additional styling it looks really cute in my opinion. Please note that since this is a <StarlightBadgeLink /> page, I use available CSS variables, like in line four:

```css "var(--sl-color-accent-low)" "var(--sl-color-accent)"
// src/styles/custom.css
.gh-badge {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: var(--sl-color-accent-low);
  border-radius: 9999px;
  padding: 0em 0.5em 0 0.3em;
  font-size: 0.9em;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: inherit;
  font-weight: 500;
  transition: background-color 0.2s ease;
  transform: translateY(0.29rem);
  border: 1px solid var(--sl-color-accent);
}

.gh-badge:hover {
  background-color: var(--sl-color-accent);
}

.gh-badge img {
  border-radius: 9999px;
  width: 1.3em;
  height: 1.3em;
}
```

Now to put everything together, let's say for example in an Astro site, you just need to add the rehype plugin to the configuration like this:

```ts ins={6-8}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import rehypeGitHubBadgeLinks from "./src/lib/rehype-github-badge-links";

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeGitHubBadgeLinks]
  }
})
```

Read more about the injection of rehype plugins in Astro in [their configuration reference](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#markdownrehypeplugins).

Do not forget to add the CSS in a similar way depending on your framework - in Starlight you can configure custom global CSS styles following [these instructions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#scoped-styles) - and you can admire your own badge links too. Feel free to share this post with anyone you want to persuade to use these features too.

If you want to use such a badge for other links too, I recommend that you craft yourself a little Astro component like this one:

```astro
---
// src/components/BadgeLink.astro
const { href, src, text, className = "gh-badge" } = Astro.props;
---

<a href={href} class={className}>
  <img src={src} alt={text} />
  {text}
</a>
```

Just make sure that the CSS is globally (or [scope](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#scoped-styles) it in the component above) and it's ready to be used:

```mdx
import BadgeLink from "../components/BadgeLink.astro";

<BadgeLink
  href="https://github.com/withastro/starlight"
  src="/starlight.png"
  text="Starlight"
/>
```
